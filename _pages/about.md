# About Me
I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar** in the **Khakh Lab at UCLA**, where I study how astrocyte morphology shapes neuronal communication and cortical network activity.  
My research combines *in vivo two-photon calcium imaging*, *molecular manipulation*, and *computational analysis* to understand glial function in the healthy and diseased brain.

# Research Interests
- Astrocyte structureâ€“function relationships  
- Two-photon imaging in awake, behaving mice  
- Glia-neuron signaling and cortical dynamics  
- Quantitative analysis of calcium imaging data
