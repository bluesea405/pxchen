# About Me
I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar** in the **Khakh Lab at UCLA**, where I study how astrocyte morphology shapes neuronal communication and cortical network activity.  
My research combines *in vivo two-photon calcium imaging*, *molecular manipulation*, and *computational analysis* to understand glial function in the healthy and diseased brain.

- Astrocyte structureâ€“function relationships  
- Two-photon imaging in awake, behaving mice  
- Glia-neuron signaling and cortical dynamics  
- Quantitative analysis of calcium imaging data

# Contributions to Science
**Sensory experience regulates glioma development** Animals constantly receive various sensory stimuli, such as odors, sounds, light, and touch, from the surrounding environment. These sensory inputs are essential for animals to search for food and avoid predators, but they also affect their physiological status and may cause diseases such as cancer. Malignant gliomas, the most lethal form of brain tumor, are known to intimately communicate with neurons at the cellular level. However, it remains unclear whether external sensory stimuli can directly affect the development of malignant glioma under normal living conditions. At the beginning of my Ph.D. training, I characterized an autochthonous mouse model that recapitulates adult gliomagenesis originating in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) (Tian et al., Adv Sci, 2020) and found that gliomas preferentially emerge in the olfactory bulb, the first relay of brain olfactory circuitry, leading to an interesting question that whether olfactory sensory experience regulates gliomagenesis. To answer this important question, I established the Omp-hM3Dq and Omp-hM4Di mouse genetic models that can activate and inhibit neuronal activities of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) separately, demonstrating that manipulating ORN activities regulate the development of glioma. I found that olfaction excites mitral and tufted (M/T) cells, which receive sensory information from ORNs and release insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in an activity-dependent manner. To unambiguously demonstrate the role of M/T cell-derived IGF1 in gliomagenesis, I established a two-recombinase mouse genetic model that can orthogonally knock out cell-specific genes and mimic gliomagenesis in the same model, demonstrating that M/T specific Igf1 can regulate gliomagenesis (Chen et al., Nature, 2022). Using sophisticated mouse genetic models, my work established a direct link between sensory experience and gliomagenesis through their corresponding sensory neuronal circuits.
