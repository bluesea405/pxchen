A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.



### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar** in the **Khakh Lab at UCLA**, where I study how astrocyte morphology shapes neuronal communication and cortical network activity.  
My research combines *in vivo two-photon calcium imaging*, *molecular manipulation*, and *computational analysis* to understand glial function in the healthy and diseased brain.
